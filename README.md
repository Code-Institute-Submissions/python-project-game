### Description
##### CREATE A 'RIDDLE-ME-THIS' GUESSING GAME
Build a web application game that asks players to guess the answer to a pictorial or text-based riddle.
The player is presented with an image or text that contains the riddle. Players enter their answer into a textarea and submit their answer using a form.
If a player guesses correctly, they are redirected to the next riddle.
If a player guesses incorrectly, their incorrect guess is stored and printed below the riddle. The textarea is cleared so they can guess again.
Multiple players can play an instance of the game at the same time. Users are identified by a unique username.
Create a leaderboard that ranks top scores for all users.
